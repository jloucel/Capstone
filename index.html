<h3>Capstone Project - <a href="https://github.com/jloucel/BrokenLinkFinder">Broken Link Finder</a></h3>
<p>The goal of this project was to consider how software development skills could be utilized 
   in a QA role. With this goal in mind I began thinking of standalone test utilities that 
   could be used in any environment. Additionally I wanted to learn how to work with the 
   Selenium WebDriver framework to automate testing tasks in web applications. 
   This project satisfied both of these objectives, as well as reinforcing key concepts 
   taught in the Computer Science program at Westminster College.
<p><em>Learning Goals satisfied by this project:</em>
<ul type="circle">
	<li>Demonstrate	evidence of	examining a	problem, designing an algorithm that solves it,
		implementing the algorithm, and testing and debugging your solution.</li>
	<li>Demonstrate	the	ability	to select the appropriate data structures necessary to support the 
		solution to a problem.</li> 
	<li>Demonstrate	proficiency in developing software in more than one programming	language and
		programming	paradigm.</li>
	<li>Demonstrate	that you understand	how	to design, write, and test objectoriented programs.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Selected Course Work</h3>
<ul type="none">
	<li><h4><a href="https://github.com/jloucel/Portfolio/blob/master/cvmm/vm.c">C Virtual Memory Manager</a></h4>
		<p> This project simulates virtual memory location access, translates virtual addresses into 
			physical memory addresses, and then outputs the value stored in the physical location. 
			Utilizing virtual memory allows operating systems to allocate exponentially 
			more memory to processes and remain performant with limited physical memory resources.
		<p><em>Learning Goals satisfied by this project:</em>
		<ul type="circle">
			<li>Demonstrate that you understand the relationship between the various levels 
				in a computer system (CPU, cache, RAM, persistent storage, network.)</li>
			<li>Demonstrate	proficiency	in developing software in more than one programming	
				language and programming paradigm.</li>
			<li>Demonstrate how computer hardware executes a program.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><h4><a href="https://github.com/jloucel/Portfolio/blob/master/sifs/exprFinal.scala">Scheme Interpreter in Scala</a></h4>
		<p> This project implements a Scheme language interpreter in Scala. The development of the final interpreter 
			was accomplished by incrementally. By adding more complex logic features such as conditional control structures,
			lambdas, and environments the interpreter gained enough functionality to support parsing a Scheme language 
			program. It could then successfully execute a Scala program to produce the expected output of the parsed 
			Scheme program.
		<p><em>Learning Goals satisfied by this project:</em>
		<ul tylpe="circle">
			<li>Demonstrate proficiency in developing software in more than one programming language 
				and programming paradigm.</li>
			<li>Demonstrate project-based work including individual assignments, working in 
				pairs, as well as larger group settings.</li>
			<li>Critical, analytical and integrative thinking.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><h4><a href="https://github.com/jloucel/Portfolio/tree/master/jga">Java Greedy vs Dynamic Algorithms</a></h4>
		<p> This project contrasts the finding of an optimal solution to a path problem between greedy and dynamic 
			algorithms. To illustrate this behavior a randomly generated board of number tiles is traversed using the 
			desired algorithm, with a score returned after traversal. The user can then observe if the greedy or dynamic 
			algorithm discovered the optimal path. The difference between the two algorithms is in how the next solution
			is derived, the greedy approach yields the best solution at a given step where the dynamic approach tries 
			all solutions and can then choose the optimal solution at each step.

	<li><h4><a href="https://github.com/jloucel/Elm/blob/master/sierpinski.elm">Sierpinski's Triangle in Elm</a></h4>
		<p> Elm is a purely functional programming language that compiles to HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The goal 
			of this project was to learn how to create an interactive program using Elm. I choose to implement 
			Sierpinski's triangle and provide the user with a slider to control the number of iterations generated.

	<li><h4><a href="https://github.com/jloucel/Portfolio/blob/master/utp/CoPrimeTest.py">Unit Testing in Python</a></h4>
		<p> I am including this program as an example of utilizing unit testing in general, as well as to suggest
			that testing can never be exhaustive. This is a simple program to generate a matrix of coprime pairs. 
			Where a pair exists an '*' is stored in the matrix (4,9) for example. I feel at 10 tests it has been 
			sufficiently, possibly over, tested, but not exhaustively tested.
