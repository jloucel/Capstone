<h3 class="mh3">Capstone Project - <a href="https://github.com/jloucel/BrokenLinkFinder">Broken Link Finder</a></h3>
<p>The goal of this project was to consider how software development skills could be utilized 
   in a QA role. With this goal in mind I began thinking of standalone test utilities that 
   could be used in any environment. Additionally I wanted to learn how to work with the 
   Selenium WebDriver framework to automate testing tasks in web applications. 
   This project satisfied both of these objectives, as well as reinforcing key concepts 
   taught in the Computer Science program at Westminster College. 

<p><em><b>Learning Goals satisfied by this project:</b></em>
<ul type="circle">
	<li>Demonstrate	evidence of	examining a	problem, designing an algorithm that solves it,
		implementing the algorithm, and testing and debugging your solution.</li>
	<li>Demonstrate	the	ability	to select the appropriate data structures necessary to support the 
		solution to a problem.</li> 
	<li>Demonstrate	proficiency in developing software in more than one programming	language and
		programming	paradigm.</li>
	<li>Demonstrate	that you understand	how	to design, write, and test objectoriented programs.</li>
</ul>
